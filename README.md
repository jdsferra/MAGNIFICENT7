##Understanding the Magnificent Seven
-This R Shiny App visualizes the Magnificent Seven Stocks from 2015 to present with an emphasis on their prices and their performance with respect to the S&P 500.
-The app is in three files, global.R, ui.R, and server.R. Libraries include shiny, shinydashboard, tidyverse, TSstudio, treemap, and plotly.
-After reading in three dataframes, one of daily prices, one of market cap data, and one of world GDP's, the app processes and plots them in several different ways.
-Open any one of the three ".R" files in RStudio and click "Run App" and it should work! Otherwise, see my deployed version at: https://jdsferra.shinyapps.io/Magnificent7.
